Let us help you keep a few strands.","overview":"<p>Syntax is a beautiful documentation template built with Tailwind CSS and Next.js, designed and built by the Tailwind CSS team.</p>\n<p>Powered by <a href=\"https://markdoc.io\">Markdoc</a>, the new Markdown-based authoring framework from Stripe, it's now easier than ever to focus on writing great documentation, instead of the tooling around it.</p>\n<p>It’s production-ready and easy to customize, making it the perfect starting point for your own documentation site.</p>\n<p>We’ve taken just as much care with the code as we have with the design, so it’s also an invaluable resource if you want to study how experts build a website with Tailwind CSS and React.</p>\n","features":"<p><strong>Built by experts</strong> — you can trust that all of the code is written following Tailwind CSS best practices, because it’s written by the same team who created and maintain the framework.</p>\n<p><strong>Easy to customize</strong> — everything is styled with utility classes, directly in the markup. No configuration variables or complex CSS to wrestle with, just open the markup in your editor and change whatever you want.</p>\n<p><strong>Built with Next.js</strong> — the template is a well-structured, thoughtfully componentized Next.js project, giving you a codebase that’s productive and enjoyable to work in.</p>\n<p><strong>Keyboard accessible</strong> — everything we build is keyboard accessible, and we carefully craft the markup to deliver the best screenreader experience we know how.</p>\n<p><strong>TypeScript or JavaScript</strong> — authored with the latest version of TypeScript by nerds who get way too much satisfaction out of getting the types just right. We also include a plain JavaScript version, just in case TypeScript isn't your thing.</p>\n<p><strong>Production-ready</strong> — rigorously tested in the latest versions of all browsers to handle lots of edge-cases you might easily miss yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>Simple to deploy</strong> — production-ready and easily deployed anywhere that you can deploy a Next.js application, like Vercel or Netlify.</p>\n","technologies":[{"name":"Next.js","version":"v15"},{"name":"Tailwind CSS","version":"v4.1"},{"name":"Headless UI","version":"v2.1"},{"name":"React","version":"v19"},{"name":"Markdoc","version":"v0.1"},{"name":"TypeScript","version":"v5.8"}],"banner_image_url":"/plus-assets/img/templates/syntax/screenshot.png","twitter_image_url":"/plus-assets/img/templates/syntax/twitter.png","images":[{"url":"/plus-assets/img/templates/syntax/detail-01.png","alt":"This is a detail image","type":"detail"},{"url":"/plus-assets/img/templates/syntax/detail-02.png","alt":"This is a detail image","type":"detail"},{"url":"/plus-assets/img/templates/syntax/detail-03.png","alt":"This is a detail image","type":"detail"},{"url":"/plus-assets/img/templates/syntax/detail-04.png","alt":"This is a detail image","type":"detail"}],"price":{"currency":"USD","advertised":99,"amount":99}},"allAccessPricing":{"currency":"USD","advertised":299,"amount":299}},"url":"/plus/templates/syntax","version":"b8fe18a8b33861319306f925e6f80217","clearHistory":false,"encryptHistory":false}
